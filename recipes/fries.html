        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Fryer oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cut and soak the potatoes.</strong><br>
                Cut your potatoes into your desired shape. You can do thick "steak cut" fries or thinner shoestring fries. This is totally up to you!
                Once they are cut, put them in a container and cover them with water. Put the container in the fridge for 24 hours while you go do something else
                like learn a new skill! <em>This is an important step that will remove starch from the fries and make them crispy.</em>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Blanch your fries.</strong><br>
                Ok, it's 24hr later. Close your book and start working on those fries! First we need to blanch them and get the moisture out. Heat your oil to 275℉ and drain your 
                fries over the sink to get rid of excess water. Put a handful of fries into the oil and let them cook for ~4 minutes. When they darken a shade or two and start to get a wrinkly skin on them, they are done blanching.
                Remove them from the fryer, let the oil drain and place them on a single layer on a sheet pan. Cool to room temp and place sheet pan in the fridge for at least 6 hours.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cook your fries</strong><br>
                You are almost there! Your fries have cooled down, now it's time for the final preparation. Bring your oil to 350℉ and put the blanched fries in.
                They will make some noise and bubble a lot, this is a good sign! Let them fry for ~5 minutes until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove from oil, let drain, and toss with some salt.
                <em>Your patience has been rewarded, and you now get to enjoy some delicious french fries. Dip them in whatever you please and enjoy the satisfying crunch.</em>
