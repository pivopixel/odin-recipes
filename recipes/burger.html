        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hamburger bun</li>
            <li>Beef patty (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
            <li>Your favorite cheese (optional)</li>
            <li>Your favorite condiments (optional)</li>
            <li>Your favorite toppings (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Season and cook the patty.</strong><br>
                Sprinkle the patty with salt and pepper. Cook using your preferred method to your preferred temperature. Personally I like a charcoal grill and 
                cooking the patty to medium rare, but this is <em>your</em> burger. Follow your heart! If you are using cheese, melt it onto the patty in the 
                last 30 seconds of cooking.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Toast your bun!</strong><br>
                Don't skip this step! Make sure to toast the cut side of your bun, this will give you a better texture, more flavor and prevent the bun from getting soggy!
            </li>
            <li><strong>Assemble your burger.</strong><br>
                The hard work is done, now it's time to get creative! You have the base, so use your imagination to come up with some great flavor combos! Here are some ideas 
                to get you started:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Spicy Guy:</strong> Garlic aioli, bacon, bleu cheese, pickled jalapenos</li>
                    <li><strong>The Greek:</strong> Arugula, lemon aioli, feta cheese, roasted red peppers</li>
                    <li><strong>The Weekender:</strong> Cheddar, bacon, grilled onions, BBQ sauce</li>
                    <li><strong>The Classic:</strong> American cheese, ketchup, mustard, pickles, lettuce, onion, tomato</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
